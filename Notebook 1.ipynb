The general idea is the same as our earlier explanations of how we trained our fastai model. Few notable differences however is the addition of 'options' in our app, giving the users the ability to change the learning rate, epochs trained and which resnet to use. resnet152 was not included in these options as the model is far too big to be trained via the Streamlit cloud. Later on it turned out that the dataloaders in general were too memory intensive to be used in the Streamlit cloud and therefore the training of the resnet model has been delegated to only local use. An important change is the slider for the learning rate. Since Streamlit does not allow the base slider values to go down to a certain number, meaning we have to divide the chosen value by a 1000. Upon choosing the required parameters the user will be able to start the training. After the initial training for the amount of epochs and learning rate chosen we will unfreeze the weights and then fine tune the newly trained model once more. Upon the training being finished we export our model as a new pickle file and allow the user to download this pickle file to set up their own prediction service.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"21881eb8-0a9e-480f-870b-e37909015bbf","is_collapsed":false,"formattedRanges":[],"deepnote_app_coordinates":{"h":2,"w":8,"x":0,"y":58},"deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-p"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def fastai_training():\n    st.header('New Image Classifier Model')\n    st.subheader('Powered by FastAi')\n    fns = get_image_files('cats/')\n    cats = DataBlock(\n        blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), \n        get_items=get_image_files, \n        splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=1),\n        get_y=parent_label,\n        item_tfms=Resize(128))\n    dls = cats.dataloaders('./cats/')\n    # Random Resize and Augmentation\n    cats = cats.new(\n    item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(224, min_scale=0.5),\n    batch_tfms=aug_transforms())\n    dls = cats.dataloaders('./cats/')\n    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)\n    col11, col12 = st.columns(2)\n    cnn_arch = col1.selectbox('Select CNN Architecture', options=['resnet50','resnet34']\n    , index = 0)\n    no_epoch = col2.slider('What is your desired number of epochs', min_value=1, max_value=50, \n    value=3, step=1)\n    learning_rate = col11.slider('What is your desired learning rate (Value divided by 1000)'\n    , min_value= 1, max_value=100, value=30, step=10)/1000\n    st.info(f'Calculated learning rate: {learning_rate}')\n    if st.button('Train Model'):\n        resnet_adv = vision_learner(dls, cnn_arch, metrics=error_rate)\n        resnet_adv.fit_one_cycle(no_epoch, learning_rate)\n        resnet_adv.unfreeze()\n        resnet_adv.fit_one_cycle(1, 1e-5)\n        resnet_adv.export('cats.pkl')\n        with open('cats.pkl', 'rb') as f:\n            # Defaults to 'application/octet-stream'\n            st.download_button('Download Model', f, file_name='cats.pkl')  \n    else:\n        st.write('Click on button to start training')","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"8ae900781d22487293e4da452658dfe0","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Google Teachable Machine","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"9c8e77794db24acdb2b434c6534a128b","is_collapsed":false,"formattedRanges":[],"deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-h3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Google Teachable Machine is a web-based machine learning tool that allows us to easily train machine learning models without needing to have any previous knowledge or experience with machine learning.
